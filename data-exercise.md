Extract transform load - vectorizing Data


1. Load data from an sql database such that each you load a join of the users and bought events.

2. Create a ranked grouping of the users who bought the most

3. Calculate the mean of the number of times each user from each campaign triggered a buy events.

4. Find out which user campaigns ranked for each event type

5. Render all possible user campaign and event types to visualize what kinds of users tended to do more kinds of events

6. Leveraging the joint query from before create a data set that can go in to a machine learning algorithm such that the target label is event type.

7. Now scale the input feature data set

8. Split the dataset in to train/test
